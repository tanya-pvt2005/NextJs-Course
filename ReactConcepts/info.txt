React has 3 core concepts
1. Components - simple
2. Props - to pass some different text
3. State

#PROPS: (short for properties) is basically an argument that we can pass to react components (like passing arguments to function)

****Note: In React, data flows down the component tree. This is referred to as one-way data flow. State, which will be discussed in the next chapter, can be passed from parent to child components as props.

Iterating through lists
can use array methods to manipulate data and generate UI elements that are identical in style but hold different pieces of information.
