React has 3 core concepts
1. Components - simple
2. Props - to pass some different text
3. State

#PROPS: (short for properties) is basically an argument that we can pass to react components (like passing arguments to function)

****Note: In React, data flows down the component tree. This is referred to as one-way data flow. State, which will be discussed in the next chapter, can be passed from parent to child components as props.

Iterating through lists
can use array methods to manipulate data and generate UI elements that are identical in style but hold different pieces of information.

#UseState hook in react
useState hook is used to change the state of the componenets. It returns an array of exactly 2 elements -> value and a setter function. You can set the initial value of the variable inside parenthesis

const[likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0)

*****Note: Unlike props which are passed to components as the first function parameter, the state is initiated and stored within a component. You can pass the state information to children components as props, but the logic for updating the state should be kept within the component where state was initially created.
